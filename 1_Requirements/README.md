## Introduction
   An online voting system is a software platform that allows groups to securely conduct votes and election.
   high quality online voting system balance ballot security ,accessibility, and the overall reqiurements of
   an organization's voting event.
   
   Online voting tools and online election voting systems help you make important decisions by gathering the input of your group in a way that’s systematic and verifiable.
   Oftentimes, these decisions are made on a yearly basis - during an event (e.g. your organization’s AGM) or at a particular time of the year. Or you might run ongoing polls        amongst your group (e.g. anonymous employee feedback surveys).

   It’s a good idea to use an online voting system to:
      Elect your leadership: A board of directors election is a good example, where there are multiple positions (e.g. chair, vice president, secretary, treasurer). All of which         may include supporting documentation (e.g. biographies, resumés, headshots).

   Admit new members to your group. This helps you stick to a regular, fair process of evaluation and lets candidates know what to expect.
      Gather anonymous feedback from your employees. Managers (and managers of managers) want to know how their employees truly feel about their jobs and work life. Using an             online voting system with a capacity for secret balloting helps employees express their true feelings, by understanding and trusting that their feedback will be heard, but         not tied directly to them.
